I am a thesis-planner master student in Jacobs school of Engineering, UC San Diego. I work closely with [Prof. Nicholas Gravish](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AEWTj-4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in [Gravish lab](http://gravishlab.ucsd.edu/index.html) on bio-inspired robotics. 

I received my bachelor degree in vehicle engineering from [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate study, I was a visiting student researcher at Dynamics and Vibration Control Lab in Australia, supervised by [Senior Prof. Weihua Li](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/weihua_li). 

My current research centers on the area of biological collective behavior, developing innovative methodologies and applications to swarm robotics system for an efficiency and robust activities.
